They can do this without a permit for 90 days a year.<br><br>Switzerland, which applied the two EU directives that guarantee lawyers from member states the right to work and practise law, agreed with the UK a service mobility agreement with a citizens’ rights provision. But only until 1 January 2023, when the agreement may be extended.<br><br>Elsewhere, a year on from the end of the Brexit transition period, solicitors face a patchwork of arrangements that fail to reflect the importance accorded to legal services in the withdrawal agreement – the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). That was the message delivered to 600 solicitors attending Tuesday’s online Law Society conference reviewing Brexit’s impact on legal practice.<br><br>Of the TCA, Society international policy adviser Michael Padua noted: ‘The language doesn’t work well with how solicitors operate.’<br><br>Categories that look promising for lawyers - for example to ‘fly in, fly out’ without permits and visas – are problematic. Provision is made for ‘contractual services providers’ who must have been employed by a business for a year and professionally qualified for three.<br><br>A route available to managers to set up a business in an EU member state is restricted to a role in the set-up; and of course is not an option if a law firm already has an office in the country. Another ‘manager’ route is restricted to activities such as taking instructions from a company board.<br><br>A route for ‘specialists’ may be subject to a test to show the expertise was not available in-country. Trainees fare better, and provided they have a degree may stay for a year.<br><br>There is a route for ‘independent professionals’ to spend a year in an EU country. They must be at least six years’ qualified. But some states treat law firm partners as employees (and therefore not ‘independent’). Others do not. ‘The usefulness of this category is in doubt,’ Padua notes.<br><br>Short-term business visitors can spend up to 90 days in every 180 in member states, a total that includes time in any Schengen Area country. Professional advisers may attend meetings, conferences and trade fairs, or engage in business development. But, crucially, and with some exceptions, they cannot charge for their time.<br><br>‘There is no standardisation as to how member states deal with their TCA obligations,’ Padua confirmed.<br><br>'We have gone from a single rule [for practice rights] for 31 countries to 27 for EU members and four EFTA states'<br><br>Marco Cillario, the Law Society<br><br>Marco Cillario, another Society international policy adviser, addressed practice rights. ‘We have gone from a single rule for 31 countries to 27 for EU members and four EFTA states,’ he noted.<br><br>The TCA sets out a commitment enabling EU and UK lawyers to advise on the law of their own country and on international public law. But member states can schedule ‘reservations’.<br><br>Still, it is ‘not all doom and gloom’, said Cillario. The Society identified nine key jurisdictions as a priority target for solicitors to practise under their home title. This has been established in seven: Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Netherlands and Ireland. Greece and Luxembourg remain more restrictive.<br><br>Belgium allows solicitors to advise on EU law, but other jurisdictions do not. And UK lawyers will not benefit from EU professional privilege.<br><br>The recognition and enforcement of judgments remains a bugbear for lawyers advising in civil, commercial and family matters. The TCA included nothing on this topic.<br><br>‘We had hoped for further declarations [on this],’ said Helena Raulus, head of the Society’s Brussels office. ‘Nothing has happened.’<br><br>Cases that began before 31 December 2020 are subject to the old rules on recognition and jurisdiction.<br><br>For cases begun after 1 January 2021, national laws apply when determining grounds for jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement. Very few historical bilateral agreements can be relied upon, as in most jurisdictions they no longer exist in law. In family law, at least, various Hague Conventions do cover areas such as child abduction and maintenance.<br><br>After the European Commission rebuffed a UK application to join the Lugano Convention, which covers jurisdiction and enforcement between the EU and EFTA countries, that route is at least temporarily blocked. Lugano, the commission argued, is a single-market mechanism, and the UK decided against remaining in the single market.<br><br>The commission argues that the Hague 2019 Convention will be a more suitable mechanism to govern E U/UK arrangements. But Hague 19 is not yet in force. It also has just five signatories to date: Costa Rica, Israel, Russia, Ukraine and Uruguay. Recognition within the EU of processes and outcomes in signatory states would not be automatic anyway.  <br><br>On jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement, Raulus predicts little further progress until ‘perhaps 2024’."

      "content": "Solicitors are concerned about the impact of automation on their jobs. But the manifold benefits of the many innovations coming to market should be a cause for celebration<br><br>Legal services are a fundamental support mechanism for our society and economy.  They provide confidence in the exchange of everything from finance, goods, services and homes. They help businesses and citizens to navigate and comply with the law while enabling them to hold to account those who do not. Legal services enable access to justice, so that all can exercise their rights, and in turn prosperity and fairness for all.<br><br>Stephen Browning<br><br>Stephen Browning<br><br>But providing legal services is resource-and knowledge-intensive. The complexity of the subject matter requires years of specialist training. There are only so many hours in the day and only so many qualified lawyers in the world. This has constrained the affordability and scalability of the service to the broader population.<br><br>How can we maximise the value that the service creates for clients, and how do we most efficiently make use of this resource so that it is more accessible for all?<br><br>Legal technologies, when developed and implemented correctly, offer the potential to improve the speed, quality and overall client experience of the service while reducing the cost. It can also create opportunities to provide new and existing services to a wider range of clients, improving access to the services and achieving better client outcomes.<br><br>In 2018 UK Research and Innovation’s (UKRI) Innovate UK and Economic and Social Research Council combined forces to stimulate innovation in high-value service sectors such as legal, understand the opportunities and challenges, and start to address barriers to developing next-generation services. By bringing together creative minds from academic, legal and technology backgrounds across 40+ projects, we have seen a diverse range of knowledge and applications developed that will shape the future of legal services and provide benefits that will span across the sector, the economy and society. Below are some examples of what can be achieved through collaborative research and innovation, and the benefits that can be delivered.<br><br>Modernising property transactions<br>Buying and selling property is a complex and slow process, vulnerable to failure and filled with risks such as fraud. Many firms have embraced solutions such as e-signatures and digital ID verification during the pandemic, but these are just two small examples of how the process can be improved. The opportunity spans much further than simply increasing the speed of the process.  <br><br>Orbital Witness has sped up the due diligence involved in the property transaction process by developing AI in collaboration with HM Land Registry and the University of Southampton. This automatically reviews and assesses the risk and complexity of commercial properties. The software has now checked hundreds of thousands of properties, which they estimate has saved over 5,000 days’ worth of time spent undertaking due diligence.<br><br>The increased speed and saved costs afford the timely delivery of value to clients. But their technology is also ‘always on’, less susceptible to the human errors inherent in lengthy manual reviews, thus allowing lawyers to focus on the unique and contentious issues of any case, thereby improving the quality of the service.<br><br>Similarly, Thirdfort is a digital ID verification platform designed for lawyers. In collaboration with Mishcon de Reya and the Land Registry, it has developed AI that has been trained to detect signs of fraud. The technology reduces the time and cost spent by solicitors undertaking fraud checks and can help protect solicitors and clients from frauds that might have been missed. So much so that insurers are now willing to offer solicitors cheaper professional indemnity cover if they use Thirdfort’s service.<br><br>The potential of AI to improve the buying and selling process has not gone unnoticed. Last autumn Oxford Brookes University’s NextGenPSF project, in conjunction with CILEx Regulation, the Solicitors Regulation Authority and Council for Licensed Conveyancers, held a conveyancing design sprint to explore how AI can ‘de-risk’ the conveyancing process and open up the market to a broader range of firms to help inform their approach.<br><br>Smarter litigation<br>Forecasting the cost of legal cases is complex and reliant on a diverse array of human experience, judgement and data. This can cause challenges in obtaining accuracy and consistency in forecasting costs, leading to uncertainty and an excessive amount of funds held in reserve by clients involved in litigation or a claim. Frontier Labs, in collaboration with Weightmans, has developed a system called MatterLab that combines human-centred design and AI to augment cost lawyers in the prediction of matter costs. By providing estimates to a much higher degree of accuracy, they enable increased confidence for both the lawyer and client while freeing up client funds to be spent elsewhere.<br><br>Meanwhile, Solomonic, a litigation intelligence platform, in collaboration with Warwick University, developed machine-learning algorithms to augment the analysis of thousands of court cases based on a large number of criteria, providing insights at speed and greater scale to litigation researchers and organisations who get into disputes. These data-driven insights are used to provide better outcome predictions for cases and data to support advice to clients.<br><br>Opening up access<br>Technology has long promised to help provide affordable access to justice. We funded Etic Lab to undertake a feasibility study for the application of data management, AI and associated technologies to support the work of those who work in affordable justice. The study identified a range of systemic barriers to the adoption of digital technologies throughout the sector and used this to inform a set of technological proposals that could help address these issues and develop solutions. These included a privacy-preserving integrated communications suite, Kuva; data tools for surveying the digital maturity of the legal advice sector; and privacy-preserving data access methods to enable insights across the legal advice sector to be shared without movement of the data.<br><br>Export finance has been traditionally reserved for larger organisations because the costs involved in managing the transaction have been too high for lenders and traders to engage with for small transactions. A significant portion of the cost emerges from the legal services involved in contract development and due diligence. Satoshi Systems has developed a commodity trading finance platform that uses AI and blockchain to standardise and automate trade finance. It also collaborated with Sullivan and Worcester to automate the contract-drafting process by identifying clauses and terms for a specific type of commodity finance transaction. The tool asks questions to the user and generates the most feasible legal agreement. Solutions such as this will drastically bring down the costs of trade finance, opening up the market to SMEs. <br><br>Where are we now?<br>When the pandemic hit, businesses across the UK faced the challenge of learning how to work remotely. This led to a wave of digital adoption that would otherwise have taken years to occur. It would be an unfair generalisation to characterise all lawyers as being technophobic, but the evidence suggests that the use of digital technologies has not been forthcoming for some time. Nevertheless, when faced with no alternative firms took the leap. We saw the use of digital signatures and ID verification, the cloud and even remote courts. Large law firms have now squarely turned their attention towards digital transformation. But the legal services market has unique challenges and is diverse, with firms of all shapes and sizes.<br><br>Oxford Brookes<br><br>Oxford Brookes University: developed AI-readiness toolkit for law firms<br><br>There have been a growing number of limited companies following 2007 reforms, but partnership law firms and the billable hour remain prevalent. Alongside these is an abundance of small, local firms not traditionally conducive to building the technological expertise and multidisciplinary skills required to transform into a data-driven organisation and innovate. There is not sufficient capital to invest in innovation, career pathways for non-lawyers are limited, and every hour away from the client immediately affects profit. Meanwhile, developing legal technology to the required standard requires high fixed costs at the outset. For example, to train a machine-learning model, lawyers may first be required to label large volumes of data to train the algorithms.<br><br>These algorithms also require large amounts of data to work effectively, which is often highly sensitive, siloed across the sector and thus difficult to access. With the impact of something going wrong on clients and firms being so high, it is understandable that a culture of risk-aversion remains prevalent. RegulAItion has developed a privacy-preserving data access platform, AIRtech, that enables data holders to collaborate with technologists without the need for data to leave the organisation so that insights can be developed without exposing sensitive data. The platform also sets up the data governance agreements and approaches, smoothing the way to start collaboration around data and overcoming human concerns around agreed data usage.<br><br>Organisations across the sector need to increase their technological awareness, engage with innovation and collaborate. Oxford Brookes University and the University of Arts London, in collaboration with UK firms and regulators, have developed an AI-readiness toolkit to help professional services firms understand what the impact of AI will mean for their business and to support the development of strategies and future plans.<br><br>Multidisciplinary skills will be essential for the future. The University of Oxford has undertaken research into the knowledge and skills required for the future lawyer, implementing a master’s degree module in law and computer science to prepare future industry leaders. It is also piloting a LawTech Education Programme to provide continuing professional development for the next generation which has now trained over 500 legal professionals. More broadly, they have created knowledge.<br><br>Collaboration is key. Unsurprisingly, the most effective solutions arise when technology is designed with the involvement of lawyers. Only then will it address the reasonable concerns of the profession. Privacy, security and clear explainability of how the system works built into a user-centred design will enable trust and smooth the path to adoption. The AI for Services network brings together data and AI businesses and academics with professionals working in law, accountancy, insurance and finance, fostering collaboration and disseminating knowledge and best practise.     <br><br>Combining the best of technology with professional knowledge and expertise will deliver something that is greater than the sum of its parts. Concerns about risks are not something to be feared, but something to be addressed. And for those concerned about the impact of automation on their role: ultimately the future of lawyering lies not in technology itself. It belongs to the lawyers involved in making it and, principally, those best making use of it.  <br><br> <br><br>Stephen Browning is interim director – AI and data economy, and the challenge director for next generation services – at UK Research and Innovation, a non-departmental public body of the UK government that directs research and innovation funding"

      "content": "We should roll into a new year filled with renewed hope and optimism. Instead, we're continuing to feel the impact of multiple converging crises like climate breakdown, the ongoing Covid pandemic and soaring inequality. Now is the time for legal professionals to consider how their choices may impact these crises to create different futures for all.<br><br>Fiona Dyer<br><br>Fiona Dyer<br><br>One manifestation of these crises is the fast deterioration of the mental health of young people and children in detention. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, children are spending longer locked up, stuck in a bottleneck of delayed court hearings. The virus has also led to 22-hour isolation, without family visits or educational activities, reaching the international threshold for cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, and even torture. Shockingly, a significant number of these children are only on remand and have not been convicted of a crime.<br><br>This localised crisis is reflective of an unstable world where children are suffering injustice as they come into contact with, or conflict with, the law. Children are being trafficked across the English Channel only to be incarcerated rather than housed, while the Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty reports that seven million children worldwide are deprived of liberty and their childhoods. <br><br>Without reform of child justice systems, things will get bleaker still.<br><br>In December 2021, a new scenario for 2025 was set out at the World Congress of Justice With Children. The research was compiled by the Global Initiative on Justice with Children with futurologists, lawyers and academics, alongside children and young people with lived experience of justice systems. 4,900 participants from 150 countries heard about the research led by Cedric Foussard, the Coordinator for the Global Initiative on Justice with Children.<br><br>The research highlights a global picture of a spiraling situation.<br><br>Extreme weather events will drive mass migration with more children flooding into creaking child justice systems, alongside weakened public health and care systems. Viral disinformation campaigns will rage that the dangerous criminal youth are either radicalised migrants or vectors of disease. In response, populist governments will buckle and crank up punitive policy on child justice and detention. Justice systems are not immune to societal changes.<br><br>The research shows that the negative and unexpected consequences of child detention are worse than previously thought, such as:<br><br>The impact on cognitive functions, physical development and long-term health.<br>Detained children are often denied the nutrition they need to grow and develop.<br>They are excluded from education and exercise. <br>Their social skills suffer, especially conflict resolution and self-control and therefore holding down a job becomes very difficult.<br>Due to all of the above, they find it hard to avoid adult incarceration.<br>The 2021 World Congress raised awareness of this chaotic trajectory and addressed the issue of the minimum age of criminal responsibility (MACR) and the minimum age of deprivation of liberty. This varies widely from country-to-country. In Scotland, the MACR threshold has been raised from eight to 12 (as part of the Age of Criminal Responsibility Act 2019).<br><br>The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child states that the MACR is 14, average for Europe. In the rest of UK, it’s just 10. <br><br>Regardless of age, we must build child-centred justice pathways for each situation or offence, informed by international human rights frameworks, while assessing the child's welfare needs. Justice systems must support children to be included and reintegrated into society. To achieve this, community based measures should be the absolute priority. The use of conflict resolution mechanisms via restorative justice, educational and mentoring programmes into society is proven to be more efficient. In the very few cases where deprivation of liberty is requested by law, children should be detained in trauma-informed secure care with education, healthcare provision and psychologists, rather than in prison-like conditions.<br><br>There is good practice out there. Germany takes a needs and rights-led approach, putting detention as a last resort, behind community activity programmes and employment. This negates the need for large, expensive detention complexes and reduces the risk of reoffending. The Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal use diversionary or restorative programmes that avoid the trauma of the trial, including techniques such as mediation with victims for first-time offenders.<br><br>The World Congress also focused on ending systemic racism and the disproportionate criminalisation of children from minority groups. It tackled discrimination against gender, sexuality and gender identification, as well as against migrants, refugees and those with disabilities or with poor health. In an increasingly divided world, inclusion remains a critical driver to deliver people-centred justice, and to fulfil the ambition of reviving the social contract, as set out in the New Common Agenda.<br><br>Participation was also a key theme. Once within the justice process, children must actively participate. They shouldn’t hurtle down a strange and formal corridor with no control or understanding of what is happening to them. Many will need speech and language support and their real age may vary greatly from their emotional and developmental age. Regardless, they must all have a voice.<br><br>The World Congress presented an alternative and brighter future scenario. The global factors were the same as those in the Global Initiative on Justice With Children's 'negative realistic' scenario.<br><br>In the aftermath of the pandemic, with the crescendoing climate crisis, caregivers, children and youth practitioners and the courts will navigate a rise in family conflict, child violence, heightened abuse and trafficking.<br><br>Imagine instead an era of new partnerships that mitigate growing harm to children through new collaboration-based advocacy and funding mechanisms. Social movements driven by children and youth spotlight their voices, such as the climate change group #FridaysforFuture, in partnership with advocacy groups and cross-disciplinary experts, who come together to set goals and determine solutions.<br><br>The Global Initiative on Justice with Children aims to initiate and to support the development of professionals, experts, children and young people and government policymakers determined to promote fair child justice systems and reform, working towards the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 16: to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.<br><br> <br><br>Fiona Dyer is director of the Children’s and Young People’s Centre for Justice at Strathclyde University"

On taking silk in 1949, aged 34, she needed permission from the Northern Circuit to remain resident in the area with her husband and daughter – a circuit rule assumed it was in the circuit’s interest for its silks to make its influence felt by being resident in London.<br><br>Even before the war, and before becoming a parent, panel discussion member professor Jo Delahunty reminded the audience, Rose Heilbron had tackled the issue of career and family life, and work-life balance, head on.<br><br>In 1939, on becoming Britain’s youngest woman barrister, Heilbron told the Daily Express: ‘I am no blue stocking. The general impression of a woman lawyer seems to be a sober old maid. I have not adopted the law as a hobby. I am serious about my career, but that does not mean I shall give up dancing, swimming, golf or tennis. Legal problems will not keep me from other jobs. I love-housekeeping and gardening. When I marry I intend to continue as a barrister. I have many men friends. Some have possibly fallen in love with me, but I have no plans for marriage. I am not in love. That does not mean I am sacrificing my life for my career. I am a home lover.’<br><br>She was appointed a Recorder at Burnley in 1956 and the first woman to be appointed a commissioner of assizes by the lord chancellor in 1962.<br><br>Jo Delahunty QC<br><br>Jo Delahunty QC<br><br>4PB<br><br>When she first sat at the Old Bailey as a Recorder in 1972, it made the news. The Liverpool Daily Post noted the fact that Heilbron was still, ‘imprisoned by masculine curiosity. The gossip columnists see more interested in finding suitable adjectives for her smile at prosecuting counsel - it is enough to strain the quality of anyone’s mercy’.<br><br>Despite being the third youngest King’s Counsel ever appointed, her daughter noted, many other milestones in Rose Heilbron’s career came later than they did for many male colleagues. And when appointed to the High Court in 1974, despite her experience in criminal law, it was to sit in the family division.<br><br>Another panel member, Old Bailey judge Wendy Joseph QC, was able to reflect on slow progress for the women who followed Rose Heilbron, followed by more rapid improvement.<br><br>Arriving at the Bailey in 2012, Joseph was only its third woman judge. ‘There was more equality in the cells,’ Joseph noted.<br><br>Yet, in 2021 women, for the first time, were half of all Old Bailey judges, and of the 163 the new Recorder appointments announced this week, 48% were women.<br><br> <br><br>My thanks to professor Jo Delahunty QC for providing the full press quotes used in this article."

      "content": "It would be wrong to think that concerns about the Pegasus spyware from NSO, the Israeli company, are behind us here in the UK, particularly in relation to lawyer confidentiality. <br><br>Jonathan Goldsmith<br><br>Jonathan Goldsmith<br><br>The spyware raised its head in the autumn in the case between the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum, and his ex-wife, Princess Haya of Jordan. The High Court ruled that he gave his express or implied authority to the hacking of his ex-wife’s phone and the phones of two of her solicitors, Lady Shackleton and Nicholas Manners from Payne Hicks Beach.<br><br>In the High Court judgment, it emerged that Lady Shackleton was warned about the hacking from two sources on the same day. One of those sources was Cherie Blair, who, it was reported, acted as an adviser to NSO on business and human rights matters. Cherie Blair had been rung by NSO itself, which claimed that they were very concerned to discover that their spyware was being used against Lady Shackleton (that’s what the evidence said), and asked Mrs Blair to contact Lady Shackleton about it.<br><br>After that, NSO took steps to ensure that no further surveillance could take place on the solicitors’ phones, and indeed the High Court records that the contract which led to the surveillance – presumably with Dubai, but the client is never revealed – was stopped, likely leading to a loss to NSO of tens of millions of dollars.<br><br>It was reported at around the same time that NSO had taken steps to ensure that its Pegasus software would no longer work on UK numbers, beginning with +44.<br><br>I hope that Mrs Blair’s telephone has never stopped ringing since the night in August 2020 when she received the call about Lady Shackleton. That is because evidence contained in a statement released last week by the Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe (CCBE) on the fall-out from the Pegasus scandal shows how lawyers have been targeted not only in the UK, but elsewhere in Europe (France, Hungary and Poland, for instance).<br><br>NSO does not use its software itself. It claims it is sold only to government intelligence and law enforcement authorities to enable those clients to identify, investigate and prevent serious crimes and terrorism, and otherwise protect public safety. Yet, funnily enough, an enquiry by the Forbidden Stories consortium and Amnesty International, which had access to 50,000 records of phone numbers selected by NSO clients in more than 50 countries since 2016, showed that many domestic journalists and lawyers were targeted. What a surprise!<br><br>The CCBE reports that in Hungary, the leaked data included the numbers of at least 10 lawyers, the President of the Hungarian Bar association among them. Just over six weeks ago, it was reported that Pegasus was used in Poland against a lawyer who is known for representing politicians from the Polish opposition. The President of the Polish Bar Council sent a letter on his behalf to the Polish government in protest.<br><br>American officials added the NSO Group to a commerce department blacklist in November 2021, banning US firms from trading with the NSO group. Of course, evidence then emerged just last week that the FBI had itself bought Pegasus, but swore it had never used it in support of any investigation.<br><br>Apple also announced in November 2021 that it was suing the NSO Group, seeking a permanent injunction to ban the company from using any Apple software, services, or devices.<br><br>What has this got to do with solicitors and the Law Society, particularly since it was announced that Pegasus would no longer be used against +44 numbers?<br><br>Well, for a start, there are thousands of solicitors who work abroad – over 10,000 of them at the last count. That is a considerable chunk of our profession at risk of being targeted by ill-intentioned governments. Our large firms abroad work on the most sensitive cases, putting their lawyers’ phones at particular risk.<br><br>Second, we are taking the say-so of a private company outside our jurisdiction that its software is no longer targeting us domestically. What it can give, it can also take away, without our even knowing it. The fact that a private company outside our jurisdiction has such power raises the same kind of questions as the control of Big Tech in general, which governments around the world are trying to bring to heel - only in the Pegasus case, governments have less incentive since they benefit from the software.<br><br>Late last year, 10 MPs wrote to our government asking it to follow in the US’s footsteps to blacklist the NSO Group. The CCBE has now similarly called on authorities in the EU ‘to protect and enhance the confidentiality of lawyer-client communications when modern technology is used’.<br><br>The Law Society should support similar targeted efforts on behalf of its members.<br><br> <br><br>Jonathan Goldsmith is Law Society Council member for EU and international matters and a former secretary general of the Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe.

      "content": "The United Kingdom and the Republic of India formally launched their negotiations on an ambitious free trade agreement (FTA) last month (13 January 2022). The announcement was made in New Delhi by the UK trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan and the Indian minister for commerce and industry Piyush Goyal.<br><br>I. Stephanie Boyce<br><br>I. Stephanie Boyce<br><br>Source: Michael Cross<br><br>The Law Society of England and Wales welcomes the start of these trade negotiations as India continues to be one of the key priority jurisdictions for its international work. There are many opportunities to increase trade in professional and business services between the UK and India and we hope both sides will collaborate on the enormous potential that exists in this sector.<br><br>India is set to become the world’s third biggest economy by 2050 and, according to the UK government, the trade deal between the two countries has the potential almost to double UK exports to India. Given the rapid growth of the Indian economy as well as the expansion of Indian companies abroad and foreign companies in India, the demands on the legal sector is expected to increase in the near future. The UK is well placed to support Indian growth through its provision of leading professional and business services.<br><br>The UK is the world’s second largest legal services market globally. Legal services contributed £60bn to the economy in 2018, supporting around 552,000 full time employees. According to the UK’s Department for International Trade, the trade agreement could create huge benefits for both countries boosting UK’s total trade up to £28 billion a year by 2035 and increase wages up to £3 billion across the UK. The government wants to ensure that UK services sector maintains its world-leading position, and this would be strengthened by greater access for UK professional and business services.<br><br>Both governments have committed to build upon the Enhanced Trade Partnership (ETP) during the trade negotiations which was launched by their respective prime ministers in May 2021. The ETP includes a focus on legal services with a commitment to remove barriers in the Indian legal services sector. Such a step could significantly increase UK legal services exports and imports from India. The UK’s services exports to India amount to £3.2 billion, while India has an expanding professional services sector which accounts for 54% of its economy.<br><br>There are benefits to the opening of the services sector to Indian industry and the Indian economy. Currently, Indian businesses have to procure foreign legal advice outside of India, be it in London, Dubai or Singapore. Greater connectivity with the UK legal services market will allow Indian companies to realise their international ambitions within India at a competitive cost. The presence of UK law firms and UK lawyers would not only facilitate international trade but also provide opportunities for young legal professionals to develop globally competitive skills without needing to leave India for another international hub.<br><br>As a part of the negotiations both governments will be considering the option of an Interim Agreement generating early benefits to both sides. The India-UK Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO) will continue to address market access barriers outside of the FTA and continue to work on improving the trading relationship between the two countries. The first round of negotiations kick-started on 17 January making it UK’s fastest start of formal talks between negotiating teams following a launch.<br><br>The Law Society welcomes this focus and is fully supportive of the UK government’s efforts to address barriers in the professional and business services sector, thereby enabling further collaboration and allowing UK’s businesses to offer expertise, increase trade, and stimulate the Indian market. We look forward to engaging with the UK government and our Indian counterparts on reaching a trade agreement which has potential to reap massive economic benefits for both countries.<br><br> <br><br>Law Society of England and Wales president I. Stephanie Boyce"
